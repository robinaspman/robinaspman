# 😎‍💻 Robin Aspman

**'Android Developer (Security Enthusiast/Problem Solver)'

I'm a self-taught junior Android Developer with large interest in security. My coding projects are built around course material, Youtube
and what I try to create/experiment on my own while searching tons of pages on Stack Overflow. 🤓 

I develop my apps with Android Studio using ideavim. I started with Javascript, HTML, CSS, React and Node but decided on
the language Java, Kotlin and Jetpack Compose. Mobile development became my focus of interest. I've also got an interest in Ethical Hacking; Python and Kali Linux.
